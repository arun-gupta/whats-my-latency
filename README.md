## üåç Why Cloudflare?

This project is a hands-on demonstration of Cloudflare's global edge network and developer platform:

- **Global Reach:** Instantly test latency to Cloudflare POPs and AWS regions around the world, showing the power of a distributed edge.
- **Real-Time Performance:** Experience how Cloudflare Workers deliver lightning-fast responses from the nearest location.
- **Developer Platform:** Built using Cloudflare Workers, this app highlights how easy it is to deploy, scale, and run code at the edge with minimal setup.
- **Interoperability:** Combines Cloudflare and AWS endpoints, showing how Cloudflare can be part of a multi-cloud or hybrid architecture.
- **Modern Web Standards:** Uses Cloudflare's support for modern JavaScript, APIs, and security best practices.
- **User Experience:** Demonstrates how Cloudflare's edge can power interactive, real-time, and globally accessible web apps.
- **Security & Bot Protection:** Uses Cloudflare Turnstile for privacy-first, user-friendly CAPTCHA to protect endpoints from bots and abuse, showcasing Cloudflare's security platform.

> **Cloudflare isn't just a CDN‚Äîit's a platform for building the next generation of fast, secure, and global applications.**

## üöÄ How It Works

- The backend (Cloudflare Worker and AWS Lambda endpoints) returns its POP/location and timestamp in a JSON response for each test.
- The frontend makes parallel requests to all endpoints, measures roundtrip times, and displays results in a table and on an interactive map.
- The map animates lines from each region to your location, and you can replay any region‚Äôs animation by clicking or using the keyboard.
- All latency results are stored in Cloudflare D1 for historical analysis.
- The frontend fetches historical data to display in a scrollable trends chart, supporting multiple chart types (line, heatmap, box plot) for comprehensive analysis and statistical insights.
- Users can trigger new latency tests in real time, and the chart updates instantly with the latest results.
- Smart validation ensures the chart only displays available data, and the UI is fully accessible and responsive.

## üõ°Ô∏è Cloudflare Turnstile Integration

This project uses [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/) to protect the stats submission endpoint from abuse and bots.

### How to Set Up Turnstile

1. **Register your site** in the [Cloudflare Turnstile dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/turnstile) and get your **Site Key** and **Secret Key**.
2. **Frontend:**
   - In `frontend/index.html`, set your Site Key in the Turnstile widget:
     ```html
     <div class="cf-turnstile" data-sitekey="YOUR_SITE_KEY_HERE"></div>
     ```
   - (You have already set: `0x4AAAAAABlib5O3WAAktnD7`)
3. **Worker:**
   - In `cloudflare-worker/wrangler.toml`, add your Secret Key as an environment variable:
     ```toml
     [vars]
     TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE"
     ```
   - The Worker will use this to verify Turnstile tokens on the `/stats` endpoint.

**Note:** Never expose your Secret Key in frontend code or public repos.

## üñ•Ô∏è Running the App Locally

1. **Install [Node.js and npx](https://nodejs.org/)** if you haven't already.
2. From the project root, run:
   ```sh
   npx serve frontend
   ```
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

**Troubleshooting:**
- If port 3000 is in use, try a different port:
  ```sh
  npx serve frontend -l 8080
  ```
  Then open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
- Leave the terminal window open while testing; closing it will stop the server.

## üïπÔ∏è Using the App

### Main Page
- The app will immediately test latency to all regions and display results in the table and on the map.
- **Re-Test**: Click the "Re-Test" button to run the tests again.
- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between Matrix, Classic, and Light themes (your choice is remembered).
- **Map**: See all regions, your location, and animated lines. Click or keyboard-activate any marker to replay the animation for that region.
- **Center on Me**: Click to center the map on your location.
- **Winner**: The fastest region is shown above the map after each test.
- **Accessibility**: All features are keyboard accessible and screen reader friendly.
- **Error Handling**: If a region can't be reached, you'll see a clear error message and icon in the table.

### Trends Page
- **Multiple Chart Types**: 
  - **Line Chart**: Shows latency trends over time for each POP
  - **Heatmap**: Shows average latency by hour for each POP
  - **Box Plot**: Shows statistical distribution (min, Q1, median, mean, Q3, max) for each POP
- **Configurable Range**: Use the slider to select 10-1000+ data points to display
- **Real-time Updates**: Click "Run Latency Test Now" to trigger new tests and refresh the chart
- **Custom Legend**: Always-visible legend showing all POPs with color coding
- **Smart Validation**: Slider automatically adjusts to available data range
- **Loading Feedback**: Visual spinner during data loading and chart updates
- **Statistical Insights**: Box plot provides comprehensive latency distribution analysis
