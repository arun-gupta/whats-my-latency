## üåç Why Cloudflare?

This project is a hands-on demonstration of Cloudflare's global edge network and developer platform:

- **Global Reach:** Instantly test latency to Cloudflare POPs and AWS regions around the world, showing the power of a distributed edge.
- **Real-Time Performance:** Experience how Cloudflare Workers deliver lightning-fast responses from the nearest location.
- **Developer Platform:** Built using Cloudflare Workers, this app highlights how easy it is to deploy, scale, and run code at the edge with minimal setup.
- **Interoperability:** Combines Cloudflare and AWS endpoints, showing how Cloudflare can be part of a multi-cloud or hybrid architecture.
- **Modern Web Standards:** Uses Cloudflare's support for modern JavaScript, APIs, and security best practices.
- **User Experience:** Demonstrates how Cloudflare's edge can power interactive, real-time, and globally accessible web apps.
- **Security & Bot Protection:** Uses Cloudflare Turnstile for privacy-first, user-friendly CAPTCHA to protect endpoints from bots and abuse, showcasing Cloudflare's security platform.

> **Cloudflare isn't just a CDN‚Äîit's a platform for building the next generation of fast, secure, and global applications.**

## üöÄ How It Works

- The backend is a Cloudflare Worker (and AWS Lambda endpoints) that returns its POP/location and timestamp in a JSON response.
- The frontend makes parallel requests to all endpoints, measures roundtrip times, and displays results in a table and on a map.
- The map animates lines from each region to your location, just like in classic "WarGames" movies.
- Click or keyboard-activate any region marker to replay the animation for that region.
- Historical data is stored in Cloudflare D1 and visualized in an interactive, scrollable chart.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Running the App Locally

1. **Install [Node.js and npx](https://nodejs.org/)** if you haven't already.
2. From the project root, run:
   ```sh
   npx serve frontend
   ```
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

**Troubleshooting:**
- If port 3000 is in use, try a different port:
  ```sh
  npx serve frontend -l 8080
  ```
  Then open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
- Leave the terminal window open while testing; closing it will stop the server.

## üõ†Ô∏è Backend API Example

A typical response from the Worker or Lambda endpoint:
```json
{
  "pop": "SFO",
  "timestamp": "2024-06-10T18:00:00Z",
  "cf_ray": "7a1b2c3d4e5f1234-SFO",
  "country": "US"
}
```
- `pop`: The edge location that handled your request (e.g., SFO, LHR)
- `timestamp`: The UTC time the request was processed
- `cf_ray`: The Cloudflare Ray ID (includes POP code)
- `country`: The detected country code

## üõ°Ô∏è Cloudflare Turnstile Integration

This project uses [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/) to protect the stats submission endpoint from abuse and bots.

### How to Set Up Turnstile

1. **Register your site** in the [Cloudflare Turnstile dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/turnstile) and get your **Site Key** and **Secret Key**.
2. **Frontend:**
   - In `frontend/index.html`, set your Site Key in the Turnstile widget:
     ```html
     <div class="cf-turnstile" data-sitekey="YOUR_SITE_KEY_HERE"></div>
     ```
   - (You have already set: `0x4AAAAAABlib5O3WAAktnD7`)
3. **Worker:**
   - In `cloudflare-worker/wrangler.toml`, add your Secret Key as an environment variable:
     ```toml
     [vars]
     TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE"
     ```
   - The Worker will use this to verify Turnstile tokens on the `/stats` endpoint.

**Note:** Never expose your Secret Key in frontend code or public repos.
